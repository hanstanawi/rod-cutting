# rod-cutting
A simple implementation of the Rod Cutting problem which applies dynamic programming paradigm

In this project, two methods were applied. The purpose of doing two different methods is to compare the time complexity difference between two methods.

The first method is Brute Force method which does not apply dynamic programming paradigm
The second method is Bottom-Up Approach which applies dynamic programming paradigm

Programming Language: JavaScript
UI: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

How to use:
1. To open the executed program, open the "index.html" file. Input the .txt file by clicking the button, then click the "Count the Revenue" button to execute the program. You will be asked the length of rod. After you have input the value, the input data will be shown under as well as the input length, maximum revenue value, cut position and execution time taken.

2. To examine the exact result, open the console by hitting the F12 button on Chrome. Select the console section. The input length, maximum revenue value, cut position and execution time taken will be shown as well.

3. There are two JavaScript files in each Brute Force and BD files which contain the functions of the algorithms. The first one is "bruteforce.js" and "dp.js", which contains the algorithm. The second one is "script.js" which contains the function to read the input data from .txt file and executes the algorithm.

4. To open the JavaScript files, just open with any text-editors.

Note: If you want to read different txt files, press F5 or refresh your browser first.
