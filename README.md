# rod-cutting
A simple implementation of the Rod Cutting problem which applies dynamic programming paradigm

In this project, two methods were applied. The purpose of doing two different methods is to compare the time complexity difference between two methods.

The first method is Brute Force method which does not apply dynamic programming paradigm
The second method is Bottom-Up Approach which applies dynamic programming paradigm
